    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    <p>posted by BGB, November 15,2016</p><br>
    This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submergethe food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely sset to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <i>Cooking for Geeks,</i> Jeff Potter describes it as "ultra-low-temperature poaching."
    
    <p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</i></b> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
